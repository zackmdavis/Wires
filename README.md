Wires is a lightwight web framework in Python, developed in tandem with its flagship application, Wires Blog Engine. To see it in action, clone the repository, navigate to the blog\_engine folder, initialize the database by running refresh\_database.bash, then run

    python3 blog_server.py

and visit *localhost:8080* in your favorite browser.

Selenium is required to run the integration tests in test/test_blog_engine.py.
